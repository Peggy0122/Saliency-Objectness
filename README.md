# Saliency-Objectness
This demo shows how to use Saliency Objectness[1], as well as Saliency 
Optimization[2], Saliency Filter[3], Geodesic Saliency[4], 
and Manifold Ranking[5].

Instructions
------------

To run the demo for default images stored in Data\SRC and perform evaluation: >>demo
The saliency maps are stored in Data\Res 

To obtain saliency maps for custom images using our approach and other methods:
(1) Add the required files to Data\SRC and run demo.
(2) Add the Objectness Proposals generated by BING [6] to BingBoxes\
Now run the demo: >>demo

To evaluate our approach and other methods, add the ground truth images to Data\GT
Now run the demo: >>demo
